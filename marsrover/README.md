# Marsrover

The marsrover application accepts an array of characters. The following characters are possible:

* L : turn left
* R : turn right
* F : move forward
* B : move backwards

In the end you should be able to get the position (X - Y coordinates)

## Extension 1
Introduce the limits of the available grid. f.e. the X range is limited between -50 and 50 and the Y range is between -100 and 100.

## Extension 2 
Introduce positions that are impossible to pass. If attempting to go into a 'blocked' position. The Mars Rover refuses to move into that position.
